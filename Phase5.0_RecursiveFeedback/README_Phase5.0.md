# Phase 5.0 – Recursive Predictive Feedback Loops

This phase introduces recursive machine learning models to enhance prime prediction based on modular phase features.

## Components
- `recursive_feedback_model.py`: Python script implementing feedback-enhanced Random Forest model
- `feedback_iterations.png`: Accuracy of predictions across feedback iterations
- `convergence_plot.png`: Line plot visualizing model convergence
- `README_Phase5.0.md`: This documentation file

## Goal
To simulate how predictive feedback—similar to reinforcement structures—can improve the modeling of prime distributions based on modular features.

## Outcome
Sustained increase in model accuracy shows promising results for modeling recursive properties of prime clustering phenomena.
