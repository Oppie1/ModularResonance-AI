# Phase 3.5 - Riemann Interference Mapping

## Overview

This phase explores the direct visual relationship between the Omega²(n) recursive prime interference structure and the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

## Key Components

- **Ω²(n) Nodes:** Complex wavefronts generated from recursive prime gaps.
- **Riemann Zeros:** Approximated nontrivial zeros aligned along the critical line Re(s) = 0.5.
- **Critical Line:** Shown as a dashed gray vertical line.

## Insights

The structure of Ω²(n) nodes exhibits clustering and oscillations that align closely with the positioning of Riemann zeta zeros. This suggests deep wave interference patterns may underlie prime number distributions.
