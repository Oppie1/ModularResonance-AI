## Phase 3.3: Zeta Bridge & Harmonic Anchoring

This phase explores the connection between the recursive prime interference function (Ω²) and the critical line of the Riemann zeta function.

We define a new complex function:
\[
\Xi(n) = \Omega^2(n) \cdot e^{-n^{1/2}}
\]
Where:
- \( \Omega^2(n) = [\pi(n) - \Psi(n)]^3 \cdot e^{i[\pi(n) - \Psi(n)]^3} \)
- \( \pi(n) \): prime counting function
- \( \Psi(n) \approx n / \log(n) \): prime density approximation

This transformation smooths and extends the prime structure into the complex plane. When plotted, the result is a harmonic interference pattern revealing:
- Phase-locked arcs and spirals
- Fractal-like symmetry in modular-resonant trajectories
- Resonance patterns potentially aligned with nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \)

**Files in this phase:**
- `zeta_bridge_analysis.py`: Computational script
- `zeta_alignment_spectrum.png`: Visualization of \( \Xi(n) \)

This marks a major step toward connecting QFPIL modular structures with deep spectral phenomena in number theory.
