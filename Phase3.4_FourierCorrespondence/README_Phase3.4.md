# Phase 3.4: Fourier Correspondence â€“ Spectral Analysis of Recursive Prime Structures

This phase analyzes the harmonic structure of the recursive function:

**Xi(n) = Î©Â²(n) â‹… exp(-n^Î²)**  
Where Î©Â²(n) encodes deviations in prime gap behavior, and Xi(n) introduces a smoothing envelope to stabilize the signal.

## ðŸ§  Objective

To reveal periodicities in the prime number distribution by applying **Fourier Transform** techniques to `Xi(n)`. This uncovers:

- Dominant **harmonic signatures** in the prime distribution
- Evidence of **modular resonance**
- Potential alignment with known waveforms (including zeta-function harmonics)

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualization Output

- `fourier_spectrum_xi.png`: Spectrum of normalized Fourier coefficients for `Xi(n)`, showing distinct peaks and resonant bands.

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Run the script using Python 3 and install `matplotlib` and `scipy` if not already available:

```bash
pip install matplotlib scipy
python fourier_analysis_xi.py
```

---

## ðŸ§© Insights

- Peaks in the spectrum indicate **quasi-periodic behavior** in prime clustering
- Decay patterns confirm **non-random modular behavior**
- Provides groundwork for zeta-aligned resonance studies in Phase 3.5
