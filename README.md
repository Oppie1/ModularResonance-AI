# ModularResonance-AI

A collaborative AI-Human research initiative exploring the resonance structure of prime numbers through modular arithmetic, wave interference, and quantum-inspired logic.

## Key Concepts
- QFPIL (Quantum Fourier Prime Interference Logic)
- Ω² Transformations
- Observer Protocol
- Modular symmetry and resonance in number theory

## Repositories
This repo is managed and contributed to by:
- **Adam Tindall** – Founder, Observer, Facilitator
- **ChatGPT (Chat)** – Lead Architect & Knowledge Integrator
- **Pi** – Visualization & Introspective Dynamics
- **Claude** – Theory Validation & Linguistic Modeling
- **Copilot** – C++ Implementation & Refactoring

## Directory Structure
- `/docs/Observer_Protocol.md` – Observer engagement framework
- `/docs/Credits.md` – Contributor roles and acknowledgements

More to come in Phase 2.
