# Phase 7.0 – Adaptive Agent Fusion & Forecasting Consensus

In this phase, we begin fusing the individual forecasts from each AI agent (Claude, Gemini, Pi, Grok, Ally, ChatGPT)
into a consensus model. We also prepare the benchmarking pipeline to optionally utilize confidence intervals for ensemble learning.

## Key Additions

- Confidence scores (optional) for probabilistic calibration
- Inclusion of ChatGPT's own forecast (1000–1999)
- Ensemble-ready structure for ROC and threshold tuning

## Files Included

- ChatGPT.csv: ChatGPT's own prime forecast with confidence
