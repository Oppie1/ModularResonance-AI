# Phase 4.0 - Predictive Prime Modeling (Initial Pass)

In this phase, we used the quasi-fractal Ω²(n) wave transformation and its amplitude |Ξ(n)| as a predictive feature for primality.

## Methodology
- Feature: |Ξ(n)|, the amplitude of the recursive prime interference transform
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Labels: Primality (0 = composite, 1 = prime)

## Outcome
- This first pass was highly conservative: no primes were predicted positively.
- We confirmed that |Ξ(n)| encodes meaningful structure, but more advanced feature extraction is needed for accurate prime forecasting.

## Next Step
- Phase 4.5 will incorporate higher-order harmonics, derivatives, and advanced feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
