# Phase 8.0 â€“ Interactive Ensemble Learning & Resonant Signal Calibration

In this phase, we explore how prime forecasting agents can interactively adjust their predictions using feedback from prior iterations. This creates a self-tuning loop inspired by modular resonance principles and signal harmonics.

## Files Included
- `interactive_ensemble.py`
- `signal_calibration.py`
- `prime_resonance_plot.png`
- `Calibrated Prime Resonance Signal`

## How to Use
1. Run `interactive_ensemble.py` to compute weighted consensus.
2. Use `signal_calibration.py` to refine calibration weights.
3. View `prime_resonance_plot.png` for harmonic signal visualization.
