# QFPIL System Design Architecture

## Overview
The Quantum-Field Prime Interference Lattice (QFPIL) is a multi-layered mathematical and computational framework that models the emergence of prime numbers as nodal points of interference in a wave-based modular field.

## Layers

1. **Input Layer: Modular Resonance Functions**
   - Inputs: Modular arithmetic sequences, Gaussian resonance conditions, Ω operators
   - Function: Generates the modular-resonant "field"

2. **Transformative Core: Ω² Operator and QFPIL Function**
   - Function: Applies recursive and nonlinear transformations to identify high-probability regions of prime emergence

3. **Interference Simulation Layer**
   - Models standing wave patterns within modular residue spaces
   - Utilizes eigenvalue stabilization and phase matching

4. **Output: Prime-Rich Zone Targeting**
   - Extracts coordinates or indices of prime-rich "nodes"
   - Optimizes for efficiency, not brute-force completeness

## Computational Principles
- Emphasizes compression, symmetry, resonance, and sparsity
- Leverages modular interference instead of traditional arithmetic sieving
