# QFPIL Mathematical Core

## Key Operators and Functions

### 1. Omega Squared (Ω²)
Defined recursively:  
Ω²(n) = Δ(Δ(n)) where Δ(n) is a transformed second-order difference operator

Produces compression signatures correlating with prime emergence.

### 2. QFPIL(x)
Wave-based function that identifies nodal interference:
QFPIL(x) ≈ Σ[ sin(k_i * x + φ_i) / x^α ] over modular lattice dimensions

### 3. Interference-Lattice Projection
- Project waveforms into modular residue space (mod m)
- Evaluate constructive overlap across multidimensional moduli

## Philosophical Parallel
Just as wavefunctions collapse into definite outcomes, primes "emerge" where QFPIL(x) amplitude peaks within stabilized Ω² fields.
