# QFPIL & Quantum Prime-State Synthesis

This module explores the synthesis of Modular Prime-State Quantum Systems with the Quasi-Fractal Prime Interference Lattice (QFPIL).

## 📊 Objective
To project the time-evolved quantum states of prime-indexed modular Hamiltonians into Fourier space and identify overlaps with QFPIL-predicted prime-dense zones.

## 📁 Contents
- `fourier_prime_state_analysis.py`: Script for Fourier transform of modular Hamiltonian evolution.
- `fourier_spectrum_comparison.png`: Visualization of frequency coherence patterns.
- `README.md`: Overview and research goals.

## 🔄 Research Context
This is Phase 3.2 of the ModularResonance-AI project, where quantum analogies and modular arithmetic are merged to uncover structural properties of prime numbers.
